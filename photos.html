            <p>I like to record my life by taking photos of my precious moments. It might be hard
                to define 'precious'. For me, everytime I click on the shutter is all PRECIOUS.
            </p>

                All photos in this page are taken by my film camera, contax G1.
                Comparing to touch the screen of my cell phone to take pictures, the shutter sound of
                film camera is always the reminder for me:
            </p>
            <p>"Oh! You just captured another excellent moment
                in your life! What a wonderful day!"</p>

                "The Contax G camera line consists of two cameras, the G1 and G2, 
                interchangeable-lens cameras sold by Kyocera under the Contax brand in 
                competition with the Leica M7, Cosina Voigtländer Bessa-R, 
                and Konica Hexar RF. The G1 was introduced in 1994 with the G2 joining it in 1996. 
                In 2005, Kyocera retreated from the camera business and announced it would cease all 
                activity related to the manufacture of Contax cameras at the end of the year, 
                effectively spelling the end of the G system." -- WikiPedia
